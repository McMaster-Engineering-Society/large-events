# Large Event Management Monorepo

A comprehensive multi-team monorepo architecture for large event management, featuring independent teams with their own APIs, web applications, and mobile apps.

## Hybrid Development Model

This monorepo supports **two development approaches**:

### 1. **Integrated Applications** (`/apps`)
- **Micro-frontend shell apps** that combine all team features
- **Single user portal** at `/` with widgets from all teams
- **Single admin portal** at `/admin` with integrated management
- **Mobile app shell** that embeds team functionality via WebViews
- **Production-ready** with optimized routing and caching

### 2. **Team Standalone Development** (`/teams`)
- Teams develop **independently** in their own repositories
- **Individual team apps** accessible at `/teams/teamX/user/` and `/teams/teamX/admin/`
- Teams can **develop and test** their features in isolation
- **Automatic integration** into the shell apps via micro-frontends or iframe fallbacks

## Team Structure

Each team maintains their own independent repository with their complete application structure. This monorepo uses **git submodules with sparse-checkout** to include only the `src/` directory from each team's repository.

**Team repositories should follow this structure:**
```
team-repository/
├── src/                     # Only this directory is checked out in monorepo
│   ├── api/                # NestJS API
│   ├── web-user/           # Next.js User Portal
│   ├── web-admin/          # Next.js Admin Panel
│   ├── mobile/             # React Native App
│   ├── shared/             # Team-specific utilities
│   └── package.json        # Team workspace configuration
├── docs/                   # Team documentation (not in monorepo)
├── tests/                  # Team tests (not in monorepo)
└── README.md               # Team README (not in monorepo)
```

## API Documentation

### Production
- **Main Portal**: http://localhost/ (integrated experience)
- **Admin Portal**: http://localhost/admin (integrated admin)

### Development
- **User Shell**: http://localhost:4000 (development)
- **Admin Shell**: http://localhost:4001 (development)
- **API Gateway**: http://localhost:3000/api
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3000/health

### Team APIs
Team APIs are accessible through the gateway at `/api/v1/teamX/` endpoints. Each team maintains their own API documentation within their repository.

### Team Standalone Apps
- **Team A**: http://localhost/teams/teamA/user/ and /teams/teamA/admin/
- **Team B**: http://localhost/teams/teamB/user/ and /teams/teamB/admin/
- **Team C**: http://localhost/teams/teamC/user/ and /teams/teamC/admin/
- **Team D**: http://localhost/teams/teamD/user/ and /teams/teamD/admin/

## Development Workflow

### Git Submodules with Sparse Checkout

Each team maintains their own repository and is included as a submodule with sparse-checkout (only `src/` directory):

```bash
# Sync all team submodules
./scripts/sync-submodules.sh

# Work on a specific team (work in their main repository)
# Teams develop in their own repositories
# Changes are pulled into the monorepo via submodule updates

# Update a team's submodule reference
cd teams/teamA
git pull origin main
cd ../..
git add teams/teamA
git commit -m "Update teamA to latest version"
```

### Setting up Team Repositories

1. **Update .gitmodules** with actual team repository URLs:
   ```bash
   # Replace <TEAM_X_REPOSITORY_URL> with actual URLs
   vim .gitmodules
   ```

2. **Initialize submodules with sparse-checkout**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/sync-submodules.sh
   ```

3. **Configure each team's repository** to have a `src/` directory with their applications

### Adding New Features

1. **Database Changes**: Update schemas in `shared/database/src/schemas/`
2. **API Types**: Update types in `shared/api-types/src/`
3. **Team Implementation**: Implement in respective team directories
4. **Integration**: Test inter-team communication

### Testing

```bash
# Run shared package tests
pnpm --filter @large-event/database test
pnpm --filter @large-event/api-types test

# Test gateway
pnpm --filter @large-event/gateway test

# Team testing is handled in their respective repositories
# Teams run their own test suites independently
```

### Deployment

#### Development
```bash
./scripts/dev-start.sh
```

#### Production
```bash
# Build all services
pnpm build

# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose --profile production up -d
```

## Project Structure Details

### Application Types

#### 1. **Integrated Applications** (`/apps`)
- **Micro-frontend shells** that combine all team features
- **Module Federation** for seamless component sharing
- **Iframe fallbacks** for teams without micro-frontend support
- **Unified navigation** and user experience

#### 2. **Shared Packages** (`/shared`)
- `@large-event/database`: Drizzle ORM schemas and database utilities
- `@large-event/api-types`: TypeScript interfaces for all APIs

#### 3. **Team Applications** (`/teams`)
- **Independent repositories** included as git submodules
- **Sparse checkout** of only the `src/` directory
